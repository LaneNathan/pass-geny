# Password Generator Starter Code
Here is my project where I worked on creating a random password generator with given starter code and a user request, I was able to write code that that asked the user to insert the amount of characters they wanted from 8-128. Then within the same group of code I was able to ask the user what characters they would like to use (upper, lower, special) and apply that to the password generator that would then give them back a password to use.
